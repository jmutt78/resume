Because it was something that I never thought was possible, I savored every single practice and every single game as though it was my last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We played Portland State, a rival of ours, in my second game as a starter. It was just like any other game until I caught a crack block that changed the course of my life forever. I stood up, barely able to walk. And when I got to the sidelines, my knee was already the size of a grapefruit. An MRI confirmed my fears when I was told that I would be out for at least 4 weeks. This changed everything. When I finally got back on the field, I lost my role and I noticed that my typical burst off the ball had significantly slowed. An undersized defensive end, my advantage had always been my speed off the ball. I quickly realized that playing Division II football was not in the cards anymore and I started to reassess my life. What’s my purpose? Why am I here? What’s next? How will I get out of college in the next decade?! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 2005, I transferred schools and came back to the front range when I learned that my father had left his job. My sister was getting her MBA and my mother was working toward her RN degree. Three out of four members of our family were in school and none of us were working… it was as wonderful as it sounds. Out of necessity, my Dad and I started a business and worked really hard to get a contract. After all, we needed something to get us through such a tough time. Since I was still a college student, I spent my breaks, entire nights, and weekends QCing work. As soon as I graduated, I filled whatever needs there were at the company: managing temp crews, supervising small teams, running VacEx machines, billing payroll, RFP, and forecasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o-1024x765.jpg\" alt=\"Justin McIntosh managing an employee\" class=\"wp-image-3339\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o-300x224.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o-768x573.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o-1536x1147.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My first 6 years in the business world were trial by fire. I’m not going to lie and tell you it was all rainbows. Truthfully, I ate a lot of shit and made more mistakes than humanly possible. But, I look back at that time as a foundation for where I am today. The lessons I learned were influential in my success later on in life.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/72421_525695117468906_2092393138_n.jpg\" alt=\"Skip and Justin McIntosh Safe Site Booth\" class=\"wp-image-3340\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/72421_525695117468906_2092393138_n.jpg 960w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/72421_525695117468906_2092393138_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/72421_525695117468906_2092393138_n-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you relate? My guess is that you’ve had some experiences that have led you to where you are today – Good or bad. To help you process here are some questions you might want to think about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What events have been formational in your development as a person? As a business person?</li><li>Is it difficult to view those formational events as foundational to your business experience? Why or why not?</li><li>How might learn from your past impact your future?</li></ol>\n","uri":"trial-by-fire","date":"2018-10-16T18:09:45"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMTE=","uri":"trial-by-fire","postId":111,"title":"Trial by Fire","featuredImage":{"altText":"Justin McIntosh managing an employee","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/326372_286023891436031_1553767268_o.jpg"}}}}
