Don’t Be Me!","content":"\n<p>After selling our family company, I had been with the new organization for about four months before my boss was fired. And, as you might predict, the person I reported to hated my guts. Needless to say, I despised my job, the organization for which I worked, and I hated where my career was going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aren’t you in a better mood now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle of this mess is where I made some of the biggest mistakes I ever made. I hope that by sharing them with you, you’re able to avoid them as much as possible. From one asshole to another, don’t take my advice lightly!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Be a Learner</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first mistake was trying to prove myself to everyone. I was not humble at all. You would have thought I learned this in my twenties, but I didn’t. Honestly, I thought I had all the answers since I had helped build a great organization. Because I thought I was God’s gift to the world, I walked around telling everyone about it. The result? I looked behind me and there no one there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a leader, even though I didn’t like my job and my boss was crazy, I should have been eager to learn and more willing to be humble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lesson learned: People don’t want to follow a person who thinks they are better than everyone. Don’t forget that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remember Why You’re on Third Base</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second mistake I made was closing myself off to everyone who had a positive influence on me and my business. I was so unsure of how my career was going to shake out that I quit trying, that I stopped building into the relationships that meant a lot to me in the past. I treated everyone that was closest to me like shit. I even pushed away one of my closest friends and business partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This huge mistake had lasting repercussions that I still feel to this day. No matter how scared or frustrated you are, you should always keep your perspective, stay positive, and maintain your relationships. In other words, don’t burn any bridges because you’re miserable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Lesson learned: You should always remain loyal to people that helped get you to where you are today. You didn’t get yourself to third base. They did.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"book shelf\" class=\"wp-image-3530\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/paul-schafer-787418-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>”&nbsp;Lesson learned: You should always remain loyal to people that helped get you to where you are today.

They did.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep your Integrity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third mistake, and the final straw, happened when leadership from my new company asked my father to retire. When I heard the news, it was a punch in the face. My father and I had done everything that they asked us to do and, evidently, it just wasn’t enough. For some reason, they wanted to keep me around and not my dad. Out of spite, I decided that I would force my way out of the company by the way I behaved. Keep in mind that this is something I’m not proud of. I’m not proud of this at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should have put in my two-week notice the moment I became disgruntled and just moved on with my life. Instead, I stuck around. I made enough waves that they eventually had to fire me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only right thing was that, before I left, I transitioned my team to a competent, reliable leader before I left. That was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lesson learned: No matter how unhappy you are in a project or job, you should always maintain your integrity. What I did was not professional, and I’m ashamed of it to this day. It wasn’t smart, and it made more negative waves than I wanted it to make. Remember, over everything else, that when all is stripped away, your integrity is what you’re left holding in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/justinmcintoshs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/rawpixel-683571-unsplash.jpg?w=1080\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be me!
