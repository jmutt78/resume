The prospect of starting a new adventure gets me up in the morning. You might be the same way. Just thinking about the next business opportunity sends your brain into overdrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You were made to be an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, let me ask you this. And it’s a question that you seriously need to consider. Do you have the balls to get through the first year of your business? Because if you don’t, you probably shouldn’t start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let that sink in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting a business takes courage. If you’ve already done it, I applaud you. If you’re getting ready to go all-in, be ready for the ultimate test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first year of my start-up, I learned that the business would never survive without the grit and sheer determination. This was especially true when it came to finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Ultimate Test</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had officially launched our business and had acquired a relatively big&nbsp;<a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/10/the-power-of-customer-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contract</a>. Along with getting equipment, we had done the difficult work of planning an infrastructure that could handle exponential&nbsp;<a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/10/hiring-your-first-managers-know-what-youre-looking-for\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growth</a>&nbsp; But, what I quickly discovered was the personal sacrifice I would have to make for the business to grow and sustain itself for the long-haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a big contract meant that we had to purchase equipment and hire employees before the client made a single payment. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. It was incredible that we had such a huge contract from the beginning. But, for the first 60 days, our company had zero cash flow. ZERO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started thinking to myself, “Was it a good idea to start this business? Am I cut out for this? How am I going to survive without a paycheck? All of my friends are taking vacations to Mexico and I’m stuck here grinding!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When those thoughts started flooding in, I could have given up. I could have thrown in the towel and decided to give up on my dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you been there before? If not, you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of quitting, I took a second job to support myself while the company grew. My dad, who worked with me, did the same thing. Neither of us took a paycheck for 7 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single dollar that came in was put back into the business. Every. Single. Dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-315896-unsplash-1024x802.jpg\" alt=\"One dollar bill\" class=\"wp-image-3440\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-315896-unsplash-1024x802.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-315896-unsplash-300x235.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-315896-unsplash-768x601.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/neonbrand-315896-unsplash-1536x1202.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“Starting a business takes courage. If you’ve already done it, I applaud you. If you’re getting ready to go all in, be ready for the ultimate test..”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>You Have What It Takes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let me ask you again. Do you have the balls to be an entrepreneur?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could you work two jobs for 7 months only getting paid for one? Could you survive without money while your buddies from college buy new cars and houses?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts will tell you that most start-ups fail within 3 years. Why is that the case? I believe it’s for two reasons. Lack of cash and lack of courage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I write this to encourage you, not to defeat you. If the thought of starting a new business gets you up in the morning, you were made to be an entrepreneur. I believe in you and am proud of you for making a leap that few people have the grit to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s my advice. When you’re tempted to give up. When you’re tempted to cut your losses and run. Don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put the money back into the business, eat Ramen noodles for every meal, so that you can look back after a decade and see what was built by your courage and ability to push through when it’s tough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/10/always-play-the-long-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Long-game thinking</a>&nbsp;is how you build a business that lasts for generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Person on a side of a cliff\" class=\"wp-image-3441\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nicholas-sampson-284246-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to starting a business, what makes you the most afraid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How have you overcome challenges in the past?
