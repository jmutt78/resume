It’s the point where something or several aspects of your business needs to change in order to bring in more money and increase market share. It becomes very clear to you that you’ve reached a plateau. Business is great, customers or clients keep coming back for more, you’re maxed out when it comes to the time you have to give to your business but you’re also spread thin and nothing is changing. This means it’s time to scale!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Growing Your Small Business</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Unfortunately, this is something that happens quite regularly with small business owners trying to double or triple business. An owner realizes he or she has reached a plateau and just starts to max out all of their human resources on repeating the same activities over and over, hoping to shift to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, it’s going to take new strategies and new initiatives at your business if you’re ever to reach new heights. What was enough for you to reach your current market share and revenue isn’t going to cut it as you grow to scale? You’ll need to incorporate new activities into your marketing and sales mix and you’re going to need to make some key hires such as an operations manager and a director of sales. You may even need to start outsourcing/contracting more work for areas such as PR and communications, wholesale sales representation, graphic design, copywriting and other potential needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ideas for Scaling Up&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different ways to grow your business. What will be the best option for you depends on your business’ unique situation, your target market, your industry, and other factors, but here are a few common strategies to get you inspired:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Expand into the wholesale business</li><li>Open a new physical location(s)&nbsp;</li><li>Launch an e-commerce site&nbsp;</li><li>Introduce new product categories or services&nbsp;</li><li>Create a strategic partnership&nbsp;</li><li>Start selling internationally or expand to new markets (if you already sell online)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/estee-janssens-aQfhbxailCs-unsplash-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2112\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/estee-janssens-aQfhbxailCs-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/estee-janssens-aQfhbxailCs-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/estee-janssens-aQfhbxailCs-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Checking in with Your Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you do anything to scale up your business, check in with your short-term, long-term and end game goals and plans. Where do you want your business to be next year? In 10 years? In 20 years? Do you have a desire to stick with your company for the long haul, or do you plan to scale up to a point where it will be salable so you can retire or move on to other pursuits like starting a new entrepreneurial venture?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Financial Considerations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that scaling up with new strategies, a new business model or any of a number of pivots will require additional capital. It’s also a great idea to develop a detailed plan outlining exactly how much money you plan to spend on what. Why? Even startups that receive millions of dollars of funding can quickly burn through money on initiatives like digital marketing and new infrastructure. The same risk is present for smaller businesses too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>How much money can you use towards reinvesting into your business?</em></li><li><em>Will you need additional funding such as a small business loan or outside investment?</em></li><li><em>Do you know what the best financial options are for your business at this time?</em></li></ul>\n","uri":"is-your-small-business-ready-for-growth"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTA3","uri":"is-your-small-business-ready-for-growth","postId":2107,"title":"Is Your Small Business Ready for Growth?"}}}
