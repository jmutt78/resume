Know What You’re Looking For","content":"\n<p>To say that we had no idea what we were getting into when we started our company would be an understatement. Have you ever felt that way? Have you ever felt like you were in over your head and ill-equipped to do the job you created for yourself? I’ve been there. The first time I felt it was when our company grew quicker than expected and the need for sturdy infrastructure became apparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m not naturally one to think about the operational side of the business. Regardless of the way I’m wired, it was something I had to prioritize if the business was going to scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The First Contract</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The day we became an official business was the day we attained a massive contract for asset audits in Texas and New Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I was in college and couldn’t devote the amount of time necessary to supervise the whole operation, it was important to hire people to manage our crews as they moved from town to town. Sounds like the logical next step, right? Well, if you’ve ever been part of a start-up, or you’ve built a business from the ground up, you know from experience that financial resources are a precious commodity. We realized very quickly that it costs money to hire new employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was essential, though, to on-board managers who could ensure the execution of our operation at that stage of our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-1024x597.jpg\" alt=\"Collaborating on a project\" class=\"wp-image-3431\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-768x448.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-1536x895.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rawpixel-678089-unsplash-1-2048x1194.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“The first time I felt it was when our company grew quicker than expected and the need for sturdy infrastructure became apparent.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Paint a Clear Picture</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What I mean is that understanding structure is important. To hire the right person, and save you money in the long run, you have to do the hard work of defining roles and responsibilities at every level of your business, from the President to low-level employee. You will have to dream five, ten, fifteen years ahead and imagine an Org Chart for a business of five or ten times the employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give each position a name. Then, define responsibilities. At the early stages of your business, and all along the way, you might not fill every role. The point is that without a clear picture of the way you want your business to operate, you will just be throwing darts, blindfolded, at a moving target.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"For hire sign\" class=\"wp-image-3432\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clem-onojeghuo-210707-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What are your natural strengths and weaknesses?
