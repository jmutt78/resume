We juggle so many different things that we have to rely heavily on other people to make it successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because team members are directly responsible for the success or failure of our business, a lot of us find people we can trust with our lives. This is why entrepreneurs tend to partner with family members. I have a software company that I operate with my father and a clothing store that I run with my wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Nepotism can be dangerous,  but when the relationship is an actual partnership, it’s a different ball game.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2874-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Father and Son in business\" class=\"wp-image-1801\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2874-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2874-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2874.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips that have worked for me when operating a business alongside a family member.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Put limitations on the amount of time you talk about work.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">My wife and I started to get burned out with our business a few years ago because we never got a break. We quickly realized that it was our fault. We talked about business all the time – weekends, nights and holidays. We decided that we were going to set boundaries on when we would discuss our company and when we wouldn’t. Nights and weekends were Matti d free unless it was an emergency. In the end, we saw a massive increase in our overall happiness and productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. Remember that your family member is a family member</strong>.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">My father and I have been working together since I was 24 years old. Throughout our professional relationship, we have had some monster arguments after which we felt like we would never speak again. Eventually, we would grab a bite to eat, and drink a beer together, and it was like nothing happened. Most of that was because, unlike me, my father is good at letting things go. It is essential that you remember that you are family and that you can’t allow the business to ruin your relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Understand that there will be disagreements and tension.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">After an argument, sit down and discuss your stressors and points of conflict. You are family, and you will need to be able to handle these issues professionally. In business, tension points and disagreements happen. And, in my opinion, it’s a good thing. Your business will create way better products when there are different perspectives involved. Make sure you and your partner know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4. Try to match your partner with complementary skills.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This is something I have done in both of my businesses. For example, I am not a great salesperson. But my father and wife are amazing salespeople. I am envious that my wife is so good at selling that she makes it look like an art form. She, on the other hand, is very unorganized and has trouble seeing the big picture. As you might expect, we lean on each other a ton, and I think it’s the reason that Matti d has been successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5. Have fun</strong>. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something I have had to remind myself of – a lot. Owning a business is hard work, stressful, and terrifying at times. When you have a family member as your partner, you have someone to walk through the trenches with. Take time to enjoy it!</p>\n","uri":"5-keys-to-working-with-family-members"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoxODAw","uri":"5-keys-to-working-with-family-members","postId":1800,"title":"5 Keys to Working with Family Members"}}}
