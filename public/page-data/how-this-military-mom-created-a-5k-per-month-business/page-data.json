An entrepreneur at heart! I learned quickly as I got older &#8211; society had a lot of decisions already made for me. Finish High School, go to college and get a corporate job. To me, that meant lots of debt from student loans, no freedom to travel, or explore my soul purpose in life, and be chained to a 9-5 job.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I knew there had to be more out there for me but I soon found myself a single mom working multiple jobs and still trying to get an education. A few years later I met an amazing man, now my husband, and he swept us off to Japan to live. There I found my love of entrepreneurship again, and started my journey of building my business.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>April went from a single mother working two jobs and going to college, one class at a time, to becoming a military spouse, and moving across the world to Japan to be with her husband.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet she still found herself in the same situation as before &#8211; stuck with no degree, limited experience, and lack of options for employment. Being told while living overseas where she could and couldn’t work was very frustrating to her as someone who is very career-oriented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Society tells us to be successful: we have to graduate high school, we continue our education, graduate college, start the 9-5 grind and then after we pay our dues, if we did all of that right, we will be successful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But my situation didn&#8217;t fit the norm, nor did my life. All I wanted to do was get a decent paying job! It seemed so simple, but the more I talked to other military spouses on base, the more I realized everyone was looking for a decent paying job, or any job for that matter, and there just wasn’t a lot of options, as we didn’t have much ability to work off base. But I knew not working wasn’t an option for me. I mean to tell you the truth, I just wanted to not fit the typical ‘you’re a military spouse, you stay at home, you’re a mom, you stay at home’ stereotype, I really wanted to prove to myself, and my husband that I could break the stereotypical norm of being a military spouse and really create an amazing career for myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks after they moved to Japan, April’s husband deployed.april</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I felt alone. It was just me and my four-year-old son in a new house, in a new freaking country. Can you even imagine? No husband, no friends, no family. Just me. To say I was overwhelmed is an understatement!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she was a woman on a mission. She may have been on her own but she was determined to not only make everything work but be a force to be reckoned with. She applied to jobs everywhere on the base, tried to make friends &#8211; and get their opinions on work options &#8211; but April said pretty much everyone said the same thing, that she was up against competing with 5,000 other spouses for all the same jobs! She was going to need more than good luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, April turned to work-from-home options, and began making connections on Facebook and LinkedIn, and eventually found a job in sales. At that point, things started to fall into place. She made some friends and had a plan worked out for childcare and school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>April was happy but the more she moved forward with it, the more she felt stuck because she couldn&#8217;t grow in the position. She didn&#8217;t have the option to pursue her passion and felt less confident in what she had to offer. A stressful job will certainly do that to a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>NEW FOUND DISCOVERY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, April started searching for other legitimate jobs she could do from home. She scrolled Facebook groups on job boards, and happened upon a lady looking for a “virtual assistant.” She basically wanted someone to work for her remotely doing a lot of personal assistant type tasks. April had never heard of a Virtual Assistant position before but felt it sounded like a dream come true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be well paid, have a flexible remote job working on various tasks tailored to what you like to do? Sounds incredible. She says she wishes she would have found out about the job role sooner as she says she would have likely been doing it her entire adult life. It’s that awesome!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her first client alone, she was already generating more income than the full-time salary position she had before moving to Japan. No degree required! She worked for about two hours a day and could spend a lot more quality time with her son. She was really enjoying herself!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was hooked and started pouring through everything she could get her hands on to get deeper and deeper into the world of working online.&nbsp; She googled, searched YouTube, scoured social media, and stalked keywords all about virtual assisting&#8211; so she could start her new career and get paid for work she actually enjoyed doing. Of course, there were setbacks as she didn&#8217;t have a lot of experience, or clients, and had zero clue how to make it more of a consistent career. Her first obstacle was operating on a Japanese foreign soil time zone. She says she found her first client accidentally but knew she needed to figure out how she could find more people who would pay her to do the same kind of work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reaching out and learning from people who were doing what she wanted to be doing, she finally started gaining momentum, and signed on four new clients! She worked fewer hours than her other job, was getting paid more than her salary, was less stressed, and was able to do it all in her pajamas with her four-year-old child from the comfort of home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She says for once, she was able to be successful and grow in a career. In just 90 days, she created consistent income and brought in 5K per month, even as a newbie Virtual Assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>FAMILY TIES</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a year of working as a Virtual Assistant, she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She fell incredibly ill and was in and out of the hospital for several weeks. She says it was a very rough pregnancy, so she didn&#8217;t want extra stress, so she ended up taking a few months off from work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 25 weeks pregnant, she and her family took a trip back to the US to celebrate her pregnancy with family members. They were excited that in 3 short months they were going to welcome a new baby girl into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately at 26 weeks pregnant &#8211; the day before heading to the airport to fly back to Japan&#8211; where they were stationed, she went into preterm labor. She was taken to the hospital and had no idea what was going to happen over the next hours, days, and weeks. Four days passed and she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. But since she delivered so early they would need to stay at the hospital for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>April says, at the time, she wasn&#8217;t sure what to do, whether she should go back to work, or how long they would be there. They were in a city they had never been to before, and halfway across the world from their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had no solid idea when they would be able to go back to Japan. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. April said it was one of the hardest times in her life both physically and mentally, as well as financially &#8211; living hotel to hotel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sheer roller coaster of emotions and uncertainties. She knew she needed an outlet. Something to keep her mind on the right track, something to keep her at ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DRIVING FORCE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>April decided to build her agency so she could have more flexibility and work shorter hours. Now, nine months after she started her agency, she says they are on track to hit six figures this year, all while helping military spouses close the gap on unemployment.<br></p>\n","uri":"how-this-military-mom-created-a-5k-per-month-business"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTI0","uri":"how-this-military-mom-created-a-5k-per-month-business","postId":2124,"title":"How this military Mom created a $5K per month business"}}}
