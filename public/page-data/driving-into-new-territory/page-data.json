Our business was booming, and we had become the experts in our field. The sky was the limit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was, however, a huge problem. When I stopped to examine the landscape from a bird’s eye view, it occurred to me that our entire business was based around utility locating. What if something catastrophic happens? What if the economy shifted and we were forced to downsize? What would we do?I went searching for services that would complement our already existing business. We had relationships with companies that did sub-service utility engineering (SUE), so I thought to myself stupidly, “It’s not rocket science. I’ve seen people do it. Let’s put a bid together!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of our reputation, we got the SUE contract and immediately. I was hit in the face by reality. Who in our company actually had experience in sub-service utility engineering? No one. Who had the margin to take on a new project? No one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had driven our business into unchartered territory because I believed in an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as not to lose my employees, I took on the new project by myself. If you’ve been reading my blog, you’re probably sensing a pattern – I’m the idea guy who desperately needs good people around him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re an entrepreneur, here’s a lesson: The success and failure of your career depend on your ability or inability to build a complementary team around you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Potholing a gas line\" class=\"wp-image-3478\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-300x225.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-768x576.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“The success and failure of your career depend on your ability or inability to build a complementary team around you.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Make a Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I lied. I didn’t just run with the new project alone. I recruited my semi-retired grandfather, and we got to work. Note that recruiting senior citizens is not the equivalent of building a good team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SUE project took off and, with a robust revenue stream, we were able to hire a few more employees. I am proud that I was able to see the situation from a bird’s eye view and take our strong business in a new direction. However, if I’m honest, and you know I am, there was one glaring mistake that I made; one misstep that I would do the next time differently:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a significant decision, that affected the future of our business, without a real plan. I took on a considerable project without really knowing what or how I was going to run it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Crew meeting\" class=\"wp-image-3479\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-300x225.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-768x576.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2029-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t hear anything else I’ve said today, understand this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a plan that includes collaboration at the lowest levels of your organization. Bring employees together, from all departments, before pulling the trigger on your seemingly revolutionary idea.</p>\n","uri":"driving-into-new-territory","date":"2018-11-20T17:49:31"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDc2","uri":"driving-into-new-territory","postId":3476,"title":"Driving into New Territory","featuredImage":{"altText":"Potholing a gas line","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/P7070277-scaled.jpg"}}}}
