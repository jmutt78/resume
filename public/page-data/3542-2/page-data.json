I didn’t know what to do next. Up until that point, I had only worked for myself and, for a brief time, the company that bought us out. The last time I interviewed for a job? Odd jobs in college. Variety of work experience? Not much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I knew was that to survive and put food on the table, and you start a business. It’s how I’m wired. It’s my DNA. So, I was in unchartered territory and utterly depressed. For an entire month, I could barely get out of bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to a therapy session with Justin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I wallowed in self-pity, I kept coming up with ideas of what I wanted to do. And every time, I would think through my plan of action and realize how long the road would be. I had minimal capital from the sale of our business, and I didn’t want to waste it all on a dumb idea. To top it all off, it seems like every article, in every business magazine, consisting of stories about how hard it was to repeat success in business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was like having a mid-life crisis at age 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The root of my problem was that I was afraid. What if I try something new and fail? What if my skills are just in my head and I’m not really that talented? Have you ever been to a place like that before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I spent another month just trying to overcome my fear. I was scared because, for the first time in my life, I had no plan of action. And I usually operate from a detailed plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miraculously, I overcame my fear with the help of an unexpected source: a video from Garry V about perspective. In his video, Garry talked about the value of perspective. The illustration he used was the universe, the fact that in the middle of our galaxy, there’s a 1 in 400 trillion chance of being born a human being. He revealed to me how lucky I had been to be a person. “Huh. I’ve never thought about that before,” I said to myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCcbHei-qmw?feature=oembed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“It was like having a mid-life crisis at age 30.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Garry’s talk got me thinking about how lucky I had been, not just for being a human, but throughout my entire life. My career path had been fantastic and thrilling. I had a family that loved me and pushed me to be the best version of myself that I could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, I gained perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I did, the ideas started flowing again.&nbsp;Mid-life&nbsp;crisis over. I wish I could tell you that the fear stayed away forever. Unfortunately, it didn’t. And that’s a story for another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice to you, and this is the reason I share all of this with you, is that anytime you’re afraid, look around at the world. Look at how fortunate you are. Hell, you have clean water to drink and a roof over your head! You can afford food! In those moments when you become so internally focused that it’s impossible to pull your head above water to see outside of the situation, imagine what it might be like to live in a third world country. When you get fearful, think about what it would be like to grow up afraid for your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-684x1024.jpg\" alt=\"leaping over a gap between rocks\" class=\"wp-image-3545\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1709w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let yourself gain perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t ever let fear overcome you and your decisions. Your fear doesn’t control you. You control your own life and, at the end of the day, you are going to be fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NGU!</p>\n","uri":"3542-2","date":"2019-01-15T17:06:50"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTQy","uri":"3542-2","postId":3542,"title":"The Only Thing to Fear is Fear Itself","featuredImage":{"altText":"leaping over a gap between rocks","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sammie-vasquez-549428-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
