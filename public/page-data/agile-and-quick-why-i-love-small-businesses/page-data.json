It was bittersweet, as you might imagine because we had worked so hard to grow the business from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I watched a new organization take apart the old business piece by piece, I was trying to figure out my career. What were my next steps? What was I passionate about? How do I put food on the table with something I enjoy? Can I stay with this new company even though my role is entirely different? You’re probably asked those kinds of questions before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout my adult life, I had only answered to myself and my clients. I had never had a boss. My new position gave me multiple bosses and my first experience in bureaucratic, corporate America. This was a reality that took some time to get used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what the experience taught me: Small businesses have a considerable advantage. They are agile can make quick moves when necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Corporate Ladder</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My new boss was great. He loved people and was knowledgeable about the business. He seemed to understand people, something that our old company valued highly. My co-workers, on the other hand, were sharp but selfish. They were in the rat race, trying to climb the corporate ladder at whatever cost to the people around them. Meetings were very professional from the outside looking in. But, over time, I quickly realized that no one listened to each other and the level of passive-aggressiveness was too much for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept my head down, becoming an expert in my area and knowing that I was still thinking through the big questions I mentioned before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"man in a suit \" class=\"wp-image-3522\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“Here’s what the experience taught me: Small businesses have a huge advantage.

Of course, I took the time to formulate a plan and run it through everyone I trusted. But, once I got buy-in, I made a move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That kind of speed does not exist in big companies like the conglomerate in which we found ourselves apart. If I wanted to make a change in a processor system, or I had an idea I wanted to try, I had to get approval from multiple people at every level of the organization. It takes forever to get things done in a large organization. Why? I think everyone is afraid to lose their job, so they focus more on covering their asses than getting the work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bureaucracy-300x212-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3523\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why I say all of that. If you’re a small business owner, enjoy it. As stressful as it can be, you are in a position to do amazing things. You are scrappy and fast. You have the ability and agility to go toe-to-toe with Goliath and come out victorious.&nbsp;</p>\n","uri":"agile-and-quick-why-i-love-small-businesses","date":"2018-12-20T18:52:22"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTE4","uri":"agile-and-quick-why-i-love-small-businesses","postId":3518,"title":"Agile and Quick: Why I Love Small Businesses","featuredImage":{"altText":"man in a suit","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hunters-race-408744-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
