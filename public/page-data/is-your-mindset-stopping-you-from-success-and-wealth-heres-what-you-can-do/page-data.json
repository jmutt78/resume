Here’s what you can do","content":"\n<p>Interview with Kisma Orbovich &#8211; CEO, Podcaster, Speaker, and Spiritual Catalyst</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kismaawake.com/about/\">Website</a><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KismaAwake/\">FaceBook</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens when working hard just isn’t enough? You might be putting 60+ hour weeks into your business and still not seeing the financial payback you’d expect. Maybe you’ve tried every shiny software or cutting-edge strategy that’s promised to be the break-through you’ve been waiting for, only to be disappointed by dismal results. If you’ve been hustling for way too long &#8211; then maybe it’s time you looked inside.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kisma Orbovich is the founder and CEO of Illumination Academy™, creator of The Prosperity Code™, and Your Prosperity Code Mentor. She helps mission-driven people (including business owners and entrepreneurs) discover what they really want and how to remove the obstacles in their way. “Once they realize they have access to all that is and that there is no limit to supply, excitement and confidence set in. It is our own doubt that gets in the way of our work” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being featured on major publications such as Entrepreneur, USA Today, and Thrive Global, Kisma is sharing insights with Entra on why having the right mindset is crucial for prosperity in business and how to start making internal changes to support your long-sought-after success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s really holding you back</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When entrepreneurs first start a business, they find their attention consumed by looking for potential opportunities, assessing the industry and competition, validating the idea, formulating a business plan, gathering funding, and so on. Yet many skip the crucial step of considering whether their mindset supports financial success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, some business owners may even feel that the intangible “mindset” is not an important aspect. Then months or years later, they find themselves still stuck without being able to pinpoint an external element hindering growth. To avoid (further) unnecessary sleepless nights, take this moment to check in with yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked what are the most common mindset obstacles she sees entrepreneurs struggle with, Kisma’s answer is fear. “They are afraid of what people think, have fear of making a mistake or fear of not being good enough. The fact is everyone makes mistakes and they are gifts that give us gems to see what can change. Without mistakes, we cannot excel.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you need to access your inner wisdom for wealth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Your Prosperity Code Mentor, Kisma helps mission-driven people awaken their inner wealth intelligence and magnetize their money. She teaches that everyone has innate wealth wisdom as they have love wisdom and joy wisdom. “By birth, we are divine and perfect. It’s the years of opinions and beliefs put on us that clouds what is ours.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are able to access this wealth intelligence by working with the Universal Laws, Kisma says you can clearly see opportunities, live in the solutions (not the problems), and become what you desire. “Once we become the frequency of what we desire we are a magnet for it. Whether that is money, or love, joy, peace.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Kisma Orbovich speaking about business and wealth.\" class=\"wp-image-2170\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-300x300.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-768x768.jpg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n-60x60.jpg 60w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/74711761_107625857246787_2266710733932129393_n.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How changing your mindset can change your life and business</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For entrepreneurs who are hesitant to consider spirituality and mindset practices because they consider it too “woo woo”, Kisma suggests looking at nature as a demonstration of the Universal Laws. “The principle of Life Force is that all expand in good. We see this in nature. Land may be destroyed but it grows back. The colors in the petal of a flower are unique and supreme. This is the law of nature and we humans are part of it. Why resist? Working against the Laws makes life more challenging.” Kisma tells that flow will come when you work WITH the Laws.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most impressive results Kisma has seen with clients have come after shifting their beliefs around money and self-worth. Some coaching clients increased their packages from $5,000-$45,000, an interior-design client purchased a building, and another client was offered to show her product on QVC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you can do today to start shifting your mindset to support your success</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are four things you can do right now as recommended by Kisma:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Focus on what IS working in your world then add gratitude</li><li>Understand that every problem is driven by its unfolding solution. If there is a problem, there is a solution.&nbsp;</li><li>Ask yourself what if you were mistaken and that your life and business aren’t actually hard? What opportunities are you missing because you are stuck in a story from the past?</li><li>Go to the Illumination Podcast and access ancient wisdom for modern-day success for free &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.illuminationpodcast.com/\">https://www.illuminationpodcast.com/</a>&nbsp;</li></ol>\n","uri":"is-your-mindset-stopping-you-from-success-and-wealth-heres-what-you-can-do"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTY4","uri":"is-your-mindset-stopping-you-from-success-and-wealth-heres-what-you-can-do","postId":2168,"title":"Is your mindset stopping you from success and wealth?
