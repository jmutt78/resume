There will be unexpected trends that force you to rely on your own self-confidence and creativity. This is the story of how I learned to do that on the fly. After years of hard work and perseverance, our business had turned into something special. I took over as the VP of operations where I was in charge of 16 directs and over 300 indirects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our small company was generating over $20 million per year in revenue, and it continued to grow at a pretty good clip. As we looked around at the industry, we began to notice a trend. One company was buying small utility locating firms and rolling them up. It was obvious that the entire industry was being consolidated. Honestly, we thought that we would always win out because of our exceptional production and friendly customer service. When one of our contracts came up for renewal, it was evident that our best qualities weren’t going to be enough. To maintain the account, we had to discount our prices so dramatically that we were barely turning a profit. At the same time, that very same organization approached us to sell our family business. They asked us to sell our baby. Imagine all of the blood, sweat, and tears that went into building it! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We decided it was the best decision for our family and our employees to sell the company and move forward with the hope that everyone would stay employed and work together well under new management. I stayed on for one year, but it was a complete disaster. They pulled me out of my usual duties and asked me to help them diversify their products. I was relieved of my team and within 3 months over 40% of my staff had left the company. To this day, when I think about what happened to a business into which I put my heart and soul, I do so with an extremely heavy heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_2874-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Justin and Skip McIntosh at awards dinner for Safe Site\" class=\"wp-image-3386\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_2874-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_2874-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_2874-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_2874.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I’m still not sure if it was the right decision to sell our business. But, looking back, it forced me to take my business knowledge and get creative with my next step in life.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did I learn? Creativity is sparked by a lack of resources. Sometimes, losing resources can be the best thing to happen to you. After leaving the company, and my wife and I decided it was time for a fresh start. We found a fantastic clothing boutique in Del Mar, CA for sale and we went for it! We packed up our family and started a new, grand adventure in southern California. Our first year was a mixture of crying, celebrating, laughing, fear, anger, frustration, and some depression. In spite of all of the things that went sideways for us, we banded together and kept grinding. Eventually, we pieced together a great staff and righted the ship. We increased our revenue over 20% year over year and, today, we are looking at expanding to new locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9243.jpg\" alt=\"Justin McIntosh in the DocuSite booth\" class=\"wp-image-3387\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9243.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9243-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9243-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m most proud of the fact that my creativity didn’t stop there. While my family was in the middle of our big transition, my father and I decided to create and design an app to help contractors protect themselves from risks in the field. After about 5 months of planning, wireframing, changing developers, and getting customer feedback, I finally launched <a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/10/www.docusites.com\">DocuSite</a>. We are still in our infancy stage, but we are showing a 99% retention rate and steady growth without any marketing budget. We bootstrapped the entire business, and, because of our confidence that comes from previous experience, we know it will be a success!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-1024x827.jpg\" alt=\"Justin McIntosh documenting a site using DocuSite\" class=\"wp-image-3388\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-1024x827.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-300x242.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-768x620.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-1536x1240.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-2048x1654.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t tell my story to brag. Yes, I’m proud of what my family and I have accomplished. But, I want you to hear two big truths:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>External trends will sometimes force you to transform your organization into something completely different.</li><li>When you find yourself lost and without resources, that’s the best time to get creative. The best ideas come when your back is up against a wall.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there any trends you see that might affect you and your organization? If your back was against the wall, what would you do?</p>\n","uri":"dealing-with-the-unexpected","date":"2018-10-19T16:44:28"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozMzgz","uri":"dealing-with-the-unexpected","postId":3383,"title":"Dealing with the Unexpected","featuredImage":{"altText":"Justin McIntosh documenting a site using DocuSite","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_8397-scaled.jpg"}}}}
