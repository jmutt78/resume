Be Humble","content":"\n<p>We finally got through the big launch our company. We hired a team, all of the equipment was ready to go, and all that was left to do was execute. Similar to most of our contracts early on, we were faced with another opportunity to prove ourselves to our client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest challenge that our team was small. We were transitioning off of another project and didn’t have enough employees to go around. I had one of two choices. I could sit around and wait for one project to be finished so we could start the next one. Or I could get my boots dirty, go out into the field to do some utility locating.I chose the latter. I had no experience utility locating. But, if we were going to move as quickly as we needed to, I had to make it happen. Remember, we’ve talked before about the power of scarcity to inspire creativity. That’s exactly what happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent three weeks training and learning as much as I could about the job and then went out on my own to start my new position as a utility locator. For seven months I ran that route. And, I’ll be honest it was probably the toughest job I’ve ever had. I dealt with pissed off contractors, problem solved for incompetent people, and helped to fix broken equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tough work was made tougher because I was wearing multiple hats for the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk.jpg\" alt=\"man at computer sad\" class=\"wp-image-3463\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk.jpg 448w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" /><figcaption>frustrated young business man working on laptop computer at office</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“Here’s what I want you to hear: No job should be too small for you. Be humble and be excited for any opportunity to learn. “</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lesson Learned</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn’t trade my experience for the world. As manager of operations, I could relate to my employees better than ever and I could smell bullshit a mile away. The most important results were huge improvements to the systems and processes of our company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I came up with a QC program that allowed our techs to ask for help without fear of feeling stupid. I instituted a bonus program based on the quality of their work and safety. I developed a piece of software that increased productivity by 22%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what I want you to hear: No job should be too small for you. Be humble and be excited for any opportunity to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I watch shows like Undercover Boss and always laugh. In each episode, I watch CEOs of major companies who have never done any of the jobs they ask their employees to do. I think to myself, “How do you make decisions if you have never even done the job?”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-1024x765.jpeg\" alt=\"utility locate marks\" class=\"wp-image-3462\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-1024x765.jpeg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-300x224.jpeg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-768x574.jpeg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-1536x1147.jpeg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0061-2048x1530.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice to you is to roll up your sleeves and do the work alongside your team. They will respect you more and you’ll gain an invaluable, in-depth understanding of your organization.</p>\n","uri":"sit-down-be-humble","date":"2018-11-13T21:17:13"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDU5","uri":"sit-down-be-humble","postId":3459,"title":"Sit Down.
