The first time I really felt that way, it was winter, and we were hiring for our next startup in Houston. I had been flying back and forth conducting interviews and getting ready for expansion into new territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first year of my start-up, I learned that the business would never survive without the grit and sheer determination. This was especially true when it came to finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle of launching new business ventures and traveling, I got a call from one of our supervisors. He sounded out of breath. He explained that a directional drilling company had damaged a high-profile gas line. Whether we had made a mistake or not wasn’t the issue. The problem was that a high-profile accident like this was not only bad for the perpetrator, but it was dangerous for the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Before we knew it, news helicopters were circling the scene of the accident and our client was pissed. I soon received a phone call our client stating that if this was our fault, they would hold us entirely responsible and were threatening to pull our contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was crazy. Nobody, absolutely nobody knew what actually happened and our clients were threatening to pull out of their contracts. All of the relational capital we had earned over the last 7 years was thrown out the window.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3495\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“You should be like a duck on the pond. On the surface, everything looks calm, but beneath the water, those little feet are churning a mile a minute.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>My Big Mistake</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The big mistake I made was that I panicked. I wore my worry on my face and let my team know how stressed out I was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, I completely lost my shit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I called my supervisors, managers, and anyone who would listen and told them to get over the site of the accident. I told them about the threats from our clients and reiterated how much bad publicity could hurt the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;You’re probably reading this thinking, “So what? Everything you said to your employees was true.” Yes, but it was the worst thing I could have done at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Hear this: As a leader of an organization, you should never let anyone see you sweat. Be vulnerable when it’s appropriate, for sure. Be relationally transparent as much as possible. But, keep your cool when you’re under fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;One of my favorite movies is&nbsp;<em>The Replacements</em>. Don’t judge. Keanu Reeves is the man! &nbsp;In the movie, Jimmy McGinty (played by Gene Hackman) gives some of the best leadership advice on the planet. He says that you should be like “a duck on the pond. On the surface, everything looks calm, but beneath the water, those little feet are churning a mile a minute.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-649x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Duck on a pond\" class=\"wp-image-3496\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-649x1024.jpg 649w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-190x300.jpg 190w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-768x1213.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-973x1536.jpg 973w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-1297x2048.jpg 1297w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1621w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be like me when I encountered my first big crisis. Don’t do what I did when I felt like I was completely in over my head. Instead, keep your cool under fire. Always be that way as a leader. Why? Your team takes their emotional queues from you in the face of trouble. Don’t let them see your confidence shaken.</p>\n","uri":"a-near-disaster-gene-hackman-and-why-you-should-keep-your-cool","date":"2018-12-05T14:39:05"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDkz","uri":"a-near-disaster-gene-hackman-and-why-you-should-keep-your-cool","postId":3493,"title":"A Near Disaster, Gene Hackman, and Why You Should Keep Your Cool","featuredImage":{"altText":"Duck on a pond","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dennis-buchner-569232-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
