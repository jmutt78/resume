Or does your brain naturally lean toward big ideas? If you’re like a lot of entrepreneurs, you aren’t necessarily a systems guy. You’re good at big ideas and finding the right people to execute. That’s me. I have had to train my brain to think a certain way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realized that our company needed a simple and reliable process for starting a project, we came up with this one. It’s not earth-shattering, but I hope it’s useful and motivates you to use a part of your brain you don’t normally tap into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How the Process Developed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time early on in our business, while we waited for a new contract, we were asked to put in a bid for one in northern Colorado where the current provider’s quality was slipping. The client needed a company to come in with fresh ideas and a drive to improve the process. We put in the bid and fortunately received the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenging part? We had one month to start the project from scratch. It was literally like having a start-up company every time we got a new contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had to buy new equipment, hire staff, train staff, and find a functional office space. Then, we had to set up new processes, find a ticket management system, and buy trucks. After a few trips around the block, I developed a simple and reliable framework for starting and executing a new project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It became second nature to everyone involved in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"trucks lined up\" class=\"wp-image-3454\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-300x300.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-150x150.jpg 150w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-768x768.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297-60x60.jpg 60w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“Make it your own. Use it as a catalyst for improving your start-up processes. Trust me, if you can tighten that up, it will save you a lot of headaches down the road.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Start Up Process</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Tasks – Write down all of the high-level tasks that need to get done. Stay away from minutiae at first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Descriptions – Write down a description of each task. This doesn’t have to be a super detailed description. The goal is for anyone to be able to pick up the task list and understand what should be done next. Here’s an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Task – Purchase Trucks.<br>Description – We require fuel-efficient pickup trucks small enough for our utility locators to maneuver in and out of job sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Subtasks – Take each task and break them down into subtasks. This is where you get into the granular parts of your project. For example, when we needed to purchase trucks we broke it down like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Task – Purchase Trucks<br>Description – We require fuel-efficient pickup trucks small enough for our utility locators to maneuver in and out of job sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SubTask 1 – Identity the right Make and Model<br>SubTask 2 – Identify a trustworthy dealer</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Assignment – Assign the tasks to the appropriate team members. Each team member is now responsible for their designated task and subtask. It’s important for you to lean on each person’s strengths. You don’t want someone who hates people to negotiate the purchase of your trucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Dates – Assign due-dates to each task and subtask. Collaborate with your team members to ensure that everyone is bought in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Track – Appoint someone to the job of tracking the entire project. He or she will need to be in constant communication with the team with up-to-date progress reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Meet – Have regular check-ins with the team so that you can help people wherever possible. For example, if John is way behind on his task, you can either dive in yourself or pull in another team member. Without regular communication, you won’t find out if John needs help until it’s too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-678x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Planner for projects\" class=\"wp-image-3453\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-199x300.jpg 199w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-768x1160.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-1017x1536.jpg 1017w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-1356x2048.jpg 1356w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stil-564521-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be You</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said before, this process isn’t rocket science, but it became extremely effective for a guy like me who loves big ideas. It’s especially important when you’re trying to pull together a project with a tight deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it your own. Use it as a catalyst for improving your start-up processes. Trust me, if you can tighten that up, it will save you a lot of headaches down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re stuck, or you want to talk through the ideas that are floating around in your brain, feel free to reach out to me at justinmcintosh7897@gmail.com</p>\n","uri":"a-helpful-process-for-your-tight-deadline","date":"2018-11-08T16:21:25"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDUx","uri":"a-helpful-process-for-your-tight-deadline","postId":3451,"title":"A Helpful Process for your Tight Deadline","featuredImage":{"altText":"trucks lined up","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_2297.jpg"}}}}
