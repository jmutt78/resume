Would you ever go into business with them? Before I became a serial entrepreneur, I would have told you that hiring family is the best move to make. After all, family members know you, empathize with you, and automatically buy into the mission and vision of your organization. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family members are no different than other employees except for one thing: you have to see them at Holiday meals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were to ask me now, I would tell you to tread lightly when it comes to hiring family. If it goes poorly, you will have to deal with some serious repercussions, not only in your business but also in your personal life. I learned that the hard way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Family Feud</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sub-service utility engineering&nbsp;<a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/11/driving-into-new-territory\">(SUE) business</a>&nbsp;was picking up steam. I had a team of 4 people that only worked on SUE projects and nothing else. The need was great for a supervisor who I could trust to run all of the projects. So, out of my naivete, I transferred my uncle to be my direct report. Early on, my relationship with my uncle was good, and the margins were even better. I decided to pour more gas on the fire and hired a salesperson, my best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was then that business really picked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our family feud began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to the point of ramping up our SUE business, we consistently had family and friends working in the company. Our only rule was that direct supervisors could not be related to their direct reports. In the SUE division, this changed. My uncle and best friend both reported to me, something I would never do again. And, if you’re thinking of on-boarding family friends, I advise you to pay attention to my story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The root of our family feud, to make a long story short, was that my best friend shared my vision and was one of the hardest workers in the company. My uncle, on the other hand, did not share my vision and became a roadblock to our success. Meetings were tense because my uncle and best friend spent most of the time arguing. My uncle was disruptive and passive aggressive toward employees at every level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I could say that I began the firing process immediately. I did not. I let him stay and become more entrenched in our systems and processes. This non-decision would come back to haunt our company for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Vacuum truck  \" class=\"wp-image-3485\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4164-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“Ultimately, you need to ask yourself if you want to run a family business or if you want to run a kick ass business that puts every candidate through the same hiring process whether they are family or not. “</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Last Straw</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One morning, like I normally would, I pulled a fuel-usage report and discovered that my uncle was filling up his personal car on our dime. That was the last straw. We fired him and moved on. Quick, painful, but absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We replaced him with an up-and-coming employee that we knew would be great for business. Things were back on track for about 4 months until one day; a phone call came in from one of our long-time clients. The client called to tell us that my uncle was poaching clients from our company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still can’t believe it. A family member came into a family-owned and operated company, downloaded its client-list and memorized its processes then started his own competing business.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"puzzle pieces \" class=\"wp-image-3486\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This was completely my fault. I tell you that story not to feel sorry for me, but for the purpose of saving you boatloads of trouble. Do not show nepotism in your business. When you do, you hire fast and fire way too slow. Hire and treat all of your employees the same and, I promise, your business will benefit in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you need to ask yourself if you want to run a family business or if you want to run a kick-ass business that puts every candidate through the same hiring process whether they are family or not.</p>\n","uri":"all-in-the-family","date":"2018-11-28T14:48:28"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDgz","uri":"all-in-the-family","postId":3483,"title":"All in the Family","featuredImage":{"altText":"puzzle pieces","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rawpixel-659503-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
