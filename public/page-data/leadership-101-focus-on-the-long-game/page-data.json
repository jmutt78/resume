Honestly, it was the scariest day of my life. Why? We put everything we had into our new project which meant there was a lot on the line. The previous owner had one foot in and one foot out for at least a year, so the boutique was severely understaffed. To make matters worse, there was only one employee who had been there for longer than 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It was what it was. Sometimes, as a leader, you have to work with the hand you’re dealt, and that’s exactly what we did. We created as many programs as possible to train our current team members while simultaneously hiring new employees who could carry the kind of culture we wanted to develop at the boutique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself stepping into an existing team as we did, you will have to do two major tasks at once: (1) Getting the most out of your current staff and (2) Hiring quality people who share your vision and passion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"group shared office\" class=\"wp-image-3587\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“As a leader, you will want to dictate some of the goals that your employees are trying to hit. Resist that temptation!”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Existing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how we squeezed out the most potential from our existing employees:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Motivation. We came up with a monthly bonus program that correlated with monthly revenue goals. After all, who doesn’t respond well to monetary incentives? The key was incentivizing team goals instead of individual performance. This went a long way toward building a sense of camaraderie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Personal growth. We developed “Goal sheets” that each team member was required to fill out every month. It was the place where each person wrote down their personal, professional goals and how they planned to better themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that there’s a tension there. As a leader, you will want to dictate some of the goals that your employees are trying to hit. Resist that temptation! Your team members will be more effective and committed if they strive toward the goals they came up with for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how we hired new employees:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Patience. We took the time to list our values and priorities as a company and weighed each candidate against them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. We maintained long-term thinking. Each week, we sat down together to remind ourselves of the fact that we weren’t putting band-aids on gaping wounds. Instead, we were building a culture that would sustain over the long haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s another tension here, too. As a leader, you’ll see glaring issues, and you’ll want to solve them through the band-aid method. Trust the process. Those issues will eventually be weeded out by&nbsp;a healthy&nbsp;company culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-1024x629.jpg\" alt=\"shaking hands\" class=\"wp-image-3588\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-1024x629.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-300x184.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-768x472.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-1536x944.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rawpixel-660716-unsplash-2048x1258.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The gist of all of this is to focus on the long game. Don’t get lost in the immediate that you forget your long-term goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NGU!</p>\n","uri":"leadership-101-focus-on-the-long-game","date":"2019-02-23T16:08:19"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTg0","uri":"leadership-101-focus-on-the-long-game","postId":3584,"title":"Leadership 101: Focus on the Long Game","featuredImage":{"altText":"group shared office","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shridhar-gupta-678685-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
