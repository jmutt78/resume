This decision will have major financial implications and could be the difference between high-growth and mounting debt. Therefore, careful research is needed based on your specific business model, product, target market, and location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief and news of prominent retailers filing for bankruptcy, brick-and-mortar retail stores still outsell e-commerce overall in the United States. In 2017 the U.S. Department of Commerce Statistics reported that while sales of e-commerce increased 16% compared to 3.6% for retail sales, the total e-commerce sales of $453 billion were overshadowed by $3496 billion from retail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than funneling all your funds into one or the other, there can be benefits to having both an online and in-person presence. This is exactly what Shahira Marei found with The Dirty Cookie, famous for its customizable cookie shots, cookie butter, and cookie dough truffles. After almost five years in business, serving celebrity clients, and being named a Tony Burch Fellow, Shahira believes she wouldn’t have come so far without the storefront she had in the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re mulling over whether to build out a brick-and-mortar, e-commerce store, or both &#8211; here are six necessary factors to assess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consider who your customers are and how they like to shop</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Shahira set up shop in Tustin, Orange County. She explains that her story isn’t typical of an entrepreneur who came up with an idea and then made it a reality. Rather, she chose the storefront before knowing what her business would be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me, it was more, I got this store and now I need to come up with something fun, new, and unique quickly. When I found the store location, I realized there was no dessert space around it and since I have the biggest sweet tooth, I decided that’s what I was going to do.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, new business owners will start out with a target market in mind to help guide their decision on whether to invest in a storefront or an online shop. Knowing your audience is key to understanding how and where they will buy. For example, in 2017 statista reported that 67% of millennials shop online compared to only 28% of seniors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/70782531_1674153952709767_4812829942794794078_n-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2147\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/70782531_1674153952709767_4812829942794794078_n-819x1024.jpg 819w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/70782531_1674153952709767_4812829942794794078_n-240x300.jpg 240w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/70782531_1674153952709767_4812829942794794078_n-768x960.jpg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/70782531_1674153952709767_4812829942794794078_n.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Envisage the experience you want customers to have</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain products sell better online and can rely heavily on digital marketing. Whereas, other types of products may need to be accessible for the public to look, touch, smell, taste, or hear. In this case for cookie shots, cookie butter, and cookie dough truffles, it made sense to have a shop so customers can see and maybe even sample the products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shahira adds that her store was instrumental in helping the team interact and understand their customers. Having a physical store could provide payoff through a proper launch, community support, foot traffic, word-of-mouth marketing, and events. Not to mention upselling thanks to solid customer service and impulse purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compare the costs and risks of e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many startups are hesitant to commit to a physical location and long term lease while in the early stages of their business. The common belief is that operating an online store will be much more affordable than a physical storefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Shahira found e-commerce to be quite costly. “In Dec 2018, I really went all-in on e-commerce and it was great”. She says that after receiving a huge spike in organic traffic and sales to their website, this motivated her to focus her marketing efforts there. “I realized after a few months it was a pay-to-play game online”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your own research, weighing up the pros and cons of each option considering the rent, build-out costs, overheads, staff, insurance, and other costs of a storefront versus buying a domain, creating a website, hosting, additional software, and management costs of an online store.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\"src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44494094_338624703366217_5587613220025898715_n-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2149\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44494094_338624703366217_5587613220025898715_n-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44494094_338624703366217_5587613220025898715_n-1-240x300.jpg 240w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44494094_338624703366217_5587613220025898715_n-1-768x960.jpg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/44494094_338624703366217_5587613220025898715_n-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Decide on your delivery methods</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you sell online, in-person, or both, you’ll still need to choose how the product will be delivered to customers. The Dirty Cookie has been shipping nationwide for three years, using USPS. Southern Californian locals can order on the various delivery apps that are changing the food industry. Additionally, customers are able to purchase online and collect from a pick-up-only location in Irvine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Look at alternatives to the traditional storefront</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I could have probably started in farmers’ markets and events to get that same feedback from people. So I don’t believe you (necessarily) need a storefront to start. E-commerce alone isn’t enough either and very expensive so I would combine it with markets and delivery services.” Shahira shares her thoughts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are many alternatives to having a traditional storefront such as pop-up shops, converted shipping containers, carts or small vans. Those in the food industry could consider a dark kitchen, also known as a cloud kitchen, which is created for the sole purpose of pick up or delivery. This provides new businesses with the option to test out their offerings in the market before scaling. It can also be more cost-effective and flexible when multiple businesses share the same space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to pivot</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One year after opening the original store in Tustin, Shahira already felt the location wouldn’t be right long-term for the brand. “It was something in the back of my mind I wanted to do but couldn’t until three years later. I cared so much about what we will people think and if it would be perceived as a sign of weakness. Eventually by the end of 2018, as I realized that location wasn’t serving our long term vision, I made the decision to close it and focus on our true goals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, The Dirty Cookie has a pick-up location in Irvine, a beautiful online store, and a huge focus on growing their B2B side with corporate events. As an experiential product, the cookie shots are a hit with celebrities and film studios such as Universal, DreamWorks, and Nickelodeon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m still growing our e-commerce side but not as aggressively as I was earlier this year. Having a storefront does add value but I don’t believe it’s necessary (for The Dirty Cookie), especially because we are so mobile and go out for private events and parties.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>VIDEO of how to enjoy cookie shots:</em><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/DmUZO-GFKmU\">https://youtu.be/DmUZO-GFKmU</a></p>\n","uri":"does-your-retail-business-need-a-storefront-or-an-online-store-maybe-both-heres-why"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTQw","uri":"does-your-retail-business-need-a-storefront-or-an-online-store-maybe-both-heres-why","postId":2140,"title":"Does your retail business need a storefront or an online store?
