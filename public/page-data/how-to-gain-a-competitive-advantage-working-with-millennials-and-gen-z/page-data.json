These game-changing generations have the serious purchasing power that only continues to grow over time. However, what’s even more impressive is how quickly they’ve been able to make an impact across so many industries, affecting the way we do business, how products are made, workplace culture, corporate responsibility and more. If you don’t have anyone from any of these cohorts on your team, now is the time to start scouting. How else can you market and sell to Millennials and Gen Z without honest, insightful, real-time feedback from members of the groups themselves?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cultivate a Culture of Safe Communication.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hierarchy has its place, but it’s crucial that every team member feel as if they can bubble up ideas and inspiration without judgment or fear of undesirable consequences on the job. Cultivate a company culture that makes it safe, healthy, and even encouraged everyone to contribute their thoughts. It’s a great way to expose yourself to new sales, customer acquisition, marketing, branding, and product development opportunities unique to Millennials and Gen Z.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/entra.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/room-l9QPabiKKhw-unsplash.jpg?fit=1024%2C683\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2067\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/room-l9QPabiKKhw-unsplash.jpg 6570w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/room-l9QPabiKKhw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/room-l9QPabiKKhw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/room-l9QPabiKKhw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6570px) 100vw, 6570px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tap In-House Resources for Market Research.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Task top Gen Z and Millennial team members with keeping their ears to the ground to find out what’s new and next among their generations. Pick their brains for their findings on new tech, new social media platforms, trending movements, trends in payment gateways and spending, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gucci has recently found plenty of success with this strategy, speeding lightyears ahead of the competition with insights from their private “shadow committee” of Gucci employees under the age of 30. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“These [young] people often know much more about certain things than you do.” </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Marco Bizzarri, CEO, Gucci </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Develop a Reverse Mentorship Program.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty behemoth, Estée Lauder, has been at the forefront of the industry for years, thanks to several new initiatives granting them greater agility and innovation, to behave more like startups than their personal goods conglomerate peers. Their reverse mentorship program has been one great contributor. Each executive in the company is matched with a junior-level employee (Millennial or Gen Z) to meet for monthly or quarterly check-ins meetings, and to be available for one another for the occasional email requesting support. The results have been stunning, benefitting both junior employees and the company’s highest-level executives alike. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We understand the importance of giving our Millennial and Gen Z employees a voice, and through reverse mentoring and advisory boards, we are engaging and empowering this group to make a meaningful impact on the business. Connecting young people’s new view of the world with the expertise of our senior leaders is adding incredible value for our company. This unique connection is creating magic.” </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabrizio Freda, President &amp; CEO, The Estée Lauder Companies</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the power of these strategies extend farther beyond enterprise companies; they’re just as viable for growth stage and startup businesses- and in such cases, even more, accessible to implement. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How can you get started today?</h4>\n","uri":"how-to-gain-a-competitive-advantage-working-with-millennials-and-gen-z"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMDY0","uri":"how-to-gain-a-competitive-advantage-working-with-millennials-and-gen-z","postId":2064,"title":"How to Gain a Competitive Advantage Working with Millennials and Gen Z"}}}
