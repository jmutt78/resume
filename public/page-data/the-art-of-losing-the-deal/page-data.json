I had left my job with no plan for what to do next. Part of me felt free (insert Free Bird background music here) while another part of me felt lost and confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of soul searching and honestly looking at our situation, I saw an opportunity! I knew I wanted to run multiple businesses. And I also knew that my wife was really into fashion. So I began researching clothing boutiques to see their margins and to get an idea of what the business is like. The other thing I knew to be true was that, while the retail industry was fading away, high-end, luxury fashion was holding steady. It was even growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with that in mind, and my desire to snap out of my funk, my wife and I decided that in the next chapter of our life, we would run a store together! We started our hunt for a clothing boutique with good margins. Our journey was one that started by teaching us three lessons about how not to negotiate a sale of a business. Here they are!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don’t show up late</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I went through all of the brokerage websites and came across a high-end retailer, located in a Colorado ski-town, next to a major resort. I spent the next 2 weeks pouring through all of their financials. Even though my gut said their price was a bit high, we were at least willing to have a conversation with them about the potential of purchasing their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife and I trekked up to the mountains to meet the owners. As you might imagine, they were 40 minutes late. – a huge red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen, if you are meeting with anyone, always be at least 5 minutes early out of respect to the other person. Don’t be so naive to think that showing up late is a power move. Most experienced business people will rule you out as a novice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don’t bring your attitude to the table</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, one of the owners of the boutique showed up, and when he did, he looked pissed to be there. The conversation was awkward because the guy obviously didn’t want to be there. I started asking questions to fill the silence. And, with every question I asked, the owner got visibly angrier. Weird, huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes without saying, but if you are selling your business, you actually have to sell it! Go in with a positive attitude and do your best to communicate all of the great things about your business. Answer questions honestly. Every business has some skeletons in their closet, for sure, and It’s best to tell a prospective buyer upfront rather than let them find out right before closing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"clothing rack\" class=\"wp-image-3554\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“It goes without saying, but if you are selling your business, you actually have to sell it! “</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don’t be an asshole</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we started talking about the price. I asked him, “Why did you price your business the way that you did?” His response? “It’s what I thought it was worth.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, I knew I had wasted my time. I shut my computer, shook the man’s hand, and walked away. It was too bad because, in the end, we could have settled on a fair price. But, I was so turned off by the owner’s behavior that I didn’t think the deal was worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Selling-Online-Business.jpg\" alt=\"for sale sign\" class=\"wp-image-3555\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Selling-Online-Business.jpg 453w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Selling-Online-Business-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My first rule in business: Don’t do business with assholes! I’ve been burned before and, in this scenario, I wasn’t going to let it happen again. I suggest you adopt the same mantra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;NGU!</p>\n","uri":"the-art-of-losing-the-deal","date":"2019-01-21T18:20:40"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTUx","uri":"the-art-of-losing-the-deal","postId":3551,"title":"The Art of Losing the Deal","featuredImage":{"altText":"clothing rack","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/s-o-c-i-a-l-c-u-t-1229801-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
