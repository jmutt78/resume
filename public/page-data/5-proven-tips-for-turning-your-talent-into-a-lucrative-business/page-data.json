You’ve probably already tried brainstorming a completely new product/service. Or perhaps, even considered expanding on, replicating, or combining existing products/services in the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The numerous possibilities can seem overwhelming, yet somehow, like it’s all been done before. If you’re stuck on how to be innovative &#8211; why not start by looking at yourself and go from there? Chances are you have a unique set of skills and experience that would be beneficial in building a product, serving clients, or running a company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no straight path in entrepreneurship and getting started is the most crucial step. That’s what Aayush Swamy found out after moving to San Diego for an opportunity that fell through. “Pretty scary considering I moved my entire life across the country and within less than a month I was out of a job,” Aayush (Yush) tells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yush never planned on being an entrepreneur but when he found himself in a tight spot, he looked at his talents and how he could make money from them. “I love storytelling and being imaginative; I’m just very blessed to have the talent to use this skill for others and bring their stories to life,” Yush shares. It’s been one year since starting the business and although he says he doesn’t have it all ‘figured out’, Yush Films is thriving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you’re looking for startup inspiration or already have a business idea based on your skills but aren’t sure how to proceed &#8211; this post will provide five tips for turning your talent into a lucrative business.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00005-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"photo of Aayush Swamy\" class=\"wp-image-2156\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00005-scaled.jpeg 2048w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00005-240x300.jpeg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take stock of your talents and how they can be used to make money</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than brainstorming business ideas &#8211; start by listing your skills, experience, and talent on a piece of paper. You might be surprised by what comes out of this simple exercise, even if it’s just a simple reminder of what you have to offer the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yush, what began as a hobby unearthed an unexpected talent. He started his YouTube channel a few years ago and even dabbled with becoming an influencer. “At the time I didn’t think to use my hobby as a career and looking back now I still feel the same. I didn’t really have a passion but more of a talent that allowed me to see it as a possible career,”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not reaching YouTube fame and making a living off the advertising, it was the quality of those videos that ultimately attracted paying clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consider if you have the characteristics of an entrepreneur</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve identified a talent that could be monetized &#8211; decide whether you actually want to proceed down the unpredictable path of entrepreneurship. Generally, successful entrepreneurs need to be self-disciplined, tenacious and have an appetite for risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yush says that his experiences growing up positively influenced his ability to create a profitable business. “I was raised to be very focused and not half-ass anything by my Dad”. This spurred him on even when quitting may have seemed like the answer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, he also mastered the skill of being ambitious without burning out. Now, Yush applies this approach to his day-to-day business operations. “This has been my way of getting the job done but also understanding that there’s more to life than a 24/7 grind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Decide whether to go all in, keep your job, or get a side hustle</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your risk appetite and financial situation, you may decide to keep your current 9-5 job or have a steady side hustle while you develop your business idea. As Yush had unexpectedly found himself without a job after moving to San Diego, he decided to go all-in on his film company. “It takes forever to edit so I couldn’t do this and another gig full time.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gave himself six months to get Yush Films off the ground and a year later, refers to himself as blessed, “I’m changing the video/photo game in SD and taking over. I knew I was ready the moment the big names wanted to work with me within my niche and it put a smile on my face.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\"src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00003-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Aayush Swamy holding an umbrella\" class=\"wp-image-2154\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00003-scaled.jpeg 2048w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image00003-240x300.jpeg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Build a portfolio &#8211; even if you don’t have clients yet</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering how to build a portfolio or collect case studies if you haven’t had any clients yet. Yush used his YouTube as a portfolio to initially sign up clients and then to showcase their work. He adds that this is definitely not the norm “I’m very fortunate for the road I’ve had so far but my biggest advice is knowing your niche and understanding what you need in your portfolio to attack that niche.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know your worth &#8211; even when you’re starting out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, many freelancers and entrepreneurs start out by offering free work in exchange for testimonials, case studies, or products/services. However, Yush cautions not to get sucked into doing too many gigs for free. “You really just need a couple of examples that show your services.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, see how to distinguish a profitable opportunity from an initial idea. <a href=\"https://entra.io/post?id=cG9zdDoyMTI5\">https://entra.io/post?id=cG9zdDoyMTI5</a><br></p>\n","uri":"5-proven-tips-for-turning-your-talent-into-a-lucrative-business"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTUy","uri":"5-proven-tips-for-turning-your-talent-into-a-lucrative-business","postId":2152,"title":"5 proven tips for turning your talent into a lucrative business"}}}
