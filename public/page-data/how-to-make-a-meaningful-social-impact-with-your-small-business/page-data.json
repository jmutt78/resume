As an aspiring, new, or even seasoned business owner &#8211; you may have the urge to help but aren’t sure where to begin. It can be daunting trying to figure out how what, and who to give to &#8211; especially as the entrepreneurial path is rarely financially stable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tara Konitshek, the owner of Tara Heather Cake Design, felt like she was not doing enough and decided to help using her existing business. “I wanted to give not for the sole purpose of just giving but to contribute to the sustainability of our environment and economy,” she explains. Tara has now partnered with Kitchens for Good in using the kitchen to combat hunger, poverty, and food waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview, Tara shares how she makes a meaningful social impact with her small business and how you can too. We’ll answer some of your burning questions to get you started in using your business for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image0-1024x698.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2164\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image0-1024x698.jpeg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image0-300x205.jpeg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image0-768x524.jpeg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image0.jpeg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is social impact?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social impact is the effect of activities on the community and well-being of individuals and families. Businesses can positively influence change with numerous approaches including donations, services, sustainable and ethical business practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tara was donating to different organizations for years when she decided to do more than just give a portion of her profit. She had noticed a growing need for sustainability in the food industry and says “I wanted to give my time by providing baking demos as well as focus on reducing the amount of waste from ingredients and supplies that I used on a weekly basis.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Do you need to donate all your profits?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to be an NGO to make a difference. For-profit businesses can make a social impact through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and/or by having a foundational component. CSR can include sustainable business practices, hiring policies, working conditions, Fair Trade, employee volunteer programs, and corporate philanthropy. Having a foundational arm of your business may mean targeted donations, grants, scholarships, and volunteer programs (Center for Social Impact 2014). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each Tara Heather Cake Design order, $9 is donated to Kitchens For Good to combat hunger using nutritious meals made with surplus produce. Kitchens For Good has saved 80 tons of cosmetically imperfect, yet perfectly edible, food from going to waste. In addition to their multiple programs, Tara is also partnering with Kitchens For Good to launch “Project Bake” in Spring 2020. Through this 12-week certified pastry apprenticeship program, Tara will mentor students to start their careers in the pastry and hospitality industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these students were previously considered “unemployable” due to complicated circumstances such as mental health, abuse, addiction, foster care, homelessness, and incarceration. Following graduation, Kitchens For Good reports that nine out of ten former students find employment. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Is your business financially stable enough to make a social impact?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re feeling uncertain about pledging a regular financial contribution to a cause, Tara says “You can always make an impact in other ways besides donating a portion of your profits such as volunteering some of your time! Keep in mind you are making an impact no matter the size of the donation”. She adds that the initial decision of donating a position of sales can be intimidating, however from her experience, she has only had positive feedback from clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-1024x1013.jpeg\" alt=\"Tara Konitshek cracking an egg\" class=\"wp-image-2163\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-1024x1013.jpeg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-300x297.jpeg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-768x760.jpeg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2-60x60.jpeg 60w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2.jpeg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Will making a social impact also benefit your business?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how you’ve chosen to make a social impact, there can be multiple benefits to your business including reducing costs from sustainable business practices, gaining customer loyalty as a socially responsible and ethical brand, as well as becoming a desirable workplace for potential employees. Tara agrees that it is essential to have team members who share a similar passion for sustainability. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you choose a cause that aligns with your brand?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve decided how and what to give, then the next step is finding an organization with similar values and a mission that is a good fit for your business and customer base. Tara wanted to partner local nonprofit in San Diego so she reached out to Social Impact Strategist, Rachel Parker-Chavez of Defining Good, to help her navigate the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“First, discover areas you are most passionate about. What lights you up, where do you feel you could make the greatest impact and feel naturally driven to commit to giving. Connect with the organization and if they are local, make the effort to visit and meet with them to see if you are both a good fit. You should feel an instant connection with the organization and be drawn to working with them. Then, start slowly.” Tara advises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she adds “Remember that it’s ok to scale back with giving when needed”.</p>\n","uri":"how-to-make-a-meaningful-social-impact-with-your-small-business"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTYy","uri":"how-to-make-a-meaningful-social-impact-with-your-small-business","postId":2162,"title":"How to make a meaningful social impact with your small business"}}}
