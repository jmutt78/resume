I was all in. So, when a supervisor position opened up, I dove headfirst into the job. It’s probably unnecessary for me to tell you this, but I was 24 and had never managed people before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My credentials? I had read a book about Management Theory and majored in Management in college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had more epic fails in the first 6 months of managing my team than I have time to tell them to you. But, I’m thankful for the experience. Why? Because out of the embarrassment came some of the best management lessons I’ve ever received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Task Master</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought conducting a meeting would go like this: I talk. People do what I say. Meeting over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After falling on my face in a few meetings, I quickly realized an important truth about people: they want to be heard. Human beings long to be known and valued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s true in marriages, friendships, or any relationship you and I have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you actually listen to your team and care about them, you will be able to reach your company’s goals free of a dictatorship. You’ll find that by creating an environment of candor in which everyone is heard, the best idea wins out, something you’ll see in your bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hire Fast</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on, our company was doing contract work, so our turnover was relatively high. I thought, “This is just the nature of the beast. I’ll hire the most willing applicants each time we start a new contract!” I don’t know if you’ve ever done this, but I spent a year filling spots with any warm body I could find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Poor results. Low morale. Great job, me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned a third valuable lesson: patience is your friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re starting out in business, you think you have to move at 100 mph, every second of the day. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like. But, the one place where you can take a breath is in the hiring process. Spend time finding good employees. Trust me, it will save you energy, time, and lots of money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Group of chairs\" class=\"wp-image-3447\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jonas-jacobsson-411044-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“I wish I could go back and punch the 24-year old version of me.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>One Size Fits All</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I assumed that the best way to manage is to treat every employee the same. After all, that’s how parents of young kids do it. Two Christmas presents for him, two for her. Birthday party with four friends for her. Same party for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it might work for toddlers, but it does not work for adults. The second lesson I learned was this: Every person has different motivations, passions, and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most challenging part of managing people is knowing them. And not just knowing them but understanding what makes them tick. It requires you to spend time with each individual on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice to you (and it’s something I wished I had known early on) is to ask direct questions like, “Where do you want to be 5 years from now? What are your professional goals? What do you love about your job? What do you hate about your job?” If you listen to each response, you’ll figure out how to adapt your style to each person’s wiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lead Like Napoleon</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be honest with you. When I got my first management position, I was young and dumb. In every sport I played growing up, I had been captain of the team. So, I figured I could just step into my new position and people would respect me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I could go back and punch the 24-year old version of me. And I suspect you wish the same thing about yourself. Am I right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth lesson I learned was that people want to be treated like people. They don’t care about your title or who you’re related to. They don’t care about your degrees or your amazing communication skills. People want to feel like you care about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, respect will come with time. Not overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/napoleon-bonaparte-jean-louis-ernest-meissonier.jpg\" alt=\"Napoleon on a horse\" class=\"wp-image-3448\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/napoleon-bonaparte-jean-louis-ernest-meissonier.jpg 637w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/napoleon-bonaparte-jean-louis-ernest-meissonier-212x300.jpg 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it. My four epic failures that taught me the four biggest lessons I’ve ever learned. Managing is more than anything you can learn in a classroom. I’ll tell you what I tell the people I mentor: Don’t try to be anybody else. People would rather follow a leader who is always real over a leader who is always right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go kick ass. I believe in you!</p>\n","uri":"my-epic-management-fails","date":"2018-11-06T17:44:48"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDQ1","uri":"my-epic-management-fails","postId":3445,"title":"My Epic Management Fails","featuredImage":{"altText":"Napoleon on a horse","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/napoleon-bonaparte-jean-louis-ernest-meissonier.jpg"}}}}
