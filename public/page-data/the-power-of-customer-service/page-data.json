And the beautiful part, especially when it comes to starting a company from scratch, is that it’s free! I learned the impact of good, customer service when my family and I were starting our business. I was in college at the time and was working long hours trying to get contracts for our fledgling company. One summer, I spent six or seven days a week, with my college roommate, doing attachment audits for a power company in Dalhart, TX. It was a tryout to see if we could handle the workload that would come from a full contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We finished the project early and had time to drive our client around to visit the sites we had completed. She was going to do a quality check anyway, so we figured we would provide the transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What could go wrong?” I thought. It was during these drives in the Texas heat that I learned my first lesson in the power of customer service. We were using archaic technology, palm pilots with external GPS systems. The problem was that the units would periodically shut down and we would have to wait for them to boot back up before moving to our next destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Starry night\" class=\"wp-image-3400\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-golus-367516-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“The most incredible part about customer service is that it’s free!”</strong>On top of the issues with the palm pilots, the A/C in our truck kept going out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you imagine what was happening? Tech issues. No Air Conditioning. Summer in Texas. Client in the front seat. Anxiety level high. Not good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle of the living hell that was a long drive with no A/C, I had a light bulb moment. “I’m going to take this woman to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I’m going to fill a cooler with drinks to combat the Texas heat. At least we’ll be comfortable along the way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s just what I did. For an entire day, full of roadblocks and set-backs, the client, my roommate, and I had a blast! We talked about life, family, business, and laughed about the absurdity of the situation. Unintentionally, my roommate and I built a relationship with the client in a way that would never have happened otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Semi truck\" class=\"wp-image-3401\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-200x300.jpg 200w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/orlando-leon-390504-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t recommend the approach we took, but I can proudly say we landed a partial contract that would turn into a multi-million-dollar contract down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did I learn through that experience? I learned that excellent customer service trumps product quality every time. We were a company with faulty technology. At face value, it didn’t look good. But, we let our honesty, integrity, and work-ethic shine by getting to know our client on a personal level. The most incredible part about customer service is that it’s free!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Customer service sign \" class=\"wp-image-3402\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mike-wilson-96168-unsplash-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a repeat customer at certain restaurants or stores?
