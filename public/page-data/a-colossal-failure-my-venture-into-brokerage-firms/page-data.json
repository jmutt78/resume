I was in the middle of launching Matti D and thought I needed to take some pressure off of the business by diversifying. Plus, I really enjoyed and understood the process of buying and selling businesses. So, I talked to a few brokers about the best franchise to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I selected the brokerage, I got to work making it a reality. In just a 3-week window, I:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Took out a small loan (small is a relative statement)</li><li>Started taking real estate classes (turns out you have to have your real estate license to broker businesses in California)</li><li>Took the real estate exam and passed<br>Went to a week of training that the franchise provided</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Not my thing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was at the training that I quickly realized something wasn’t right. The company didn’t seem to provide support and, to make matters worse, brokering required skills that were not in my wheelhouse. I am a great manager and operator, but I am not the best salesman. As a brokerage owner, it was my job to convince (a.k.a. sell) an owner to sell their business. I got into the game to help business owners get the most out of their companies, not force them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent 2 years as the owner of a brokerage franchise. After all, I was invested. I held meetings, attended networking events, and went to businesses just trying to make it work. I couldn’t get one client. I would get close only to hear the owner say that he or she wanted to hold onto the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did my new company tell me? They told me to buy a service package that included people who would make cold calls on my behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the last straw. I shut down the business. Defeated. Embarrassed. A failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk.jpg\" alt=\"man at computer sad\" class=\"wp-image-3463\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk.jpg 448w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Humble-Mindset-and-Success-Business-man-looking-down-at-desk-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" /><figcaption>frustrated young business man working on laptop computer at office</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“I rushed into the purchase because of an urgent desire to diversify my resources.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hard lessons learned</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had failed before but never had one of my failures cost this much money. Looking back, I rushed into the purchase because of an urgent desire to diversify my resources. Have you ever been there before? Have you ever done something impulsive only to look back and wish you hadn’t?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It happens to all of us. Because I don’t believe pain and suffering should ever go to waste, here are 3 big lessons I learned in the middle of my own season of suffering:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Do your research before you leap. Make sure that the business you are getting into plays to your strengths. My strength was never and is still not selling. My strengths are managing and operating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Do not compound one issue by taking on more. I was knee-deep in Matti D, and I thought the best way to help was to take pressure off the business. I should have just stayed the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Realize you made a mistake and move on as quickly as possible. Once you realize you fucked up, swallow your pride and move on. I dragged on with brokering for at least 8 months more than I should have. I was burning through cash and wasting time that I could have been spending on a more profitable venture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"man sad\" class=\"wp-image-3595\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tr-n-toan-1139337-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you in the middle of a similar failure?
