In 2 short years, we went from a small team of 20 to a business with over 100 employees. The entire state of Colorado was ours and I was tasked with managing the new territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job came with some challenges, the biggest of which was putting the right people in place. Utility locating isn’t a walk in the park. It takes a lot of training and even when you think someone is ready, the job can still be risky and result in serious injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was faced with a temptation that every leader goes through at some point in his or her career. Do I hire and train people who are willing and skilled? Or do I hire and train people who fit the kind of culture we were creating at the company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the most arduous processes I’ve ever been a part of, but because we chose to prioritize culture, we reaped major benefits down the road with higher levels of employee satisfaction and a lower rate of turnover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding Good People</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step was to get my management team in place. I started by gathering recommendations from trusted clients. One of the people I decided to hire, to give you an idea of my approach, was someone with zero management experience and only 2 years of prior knowledge in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was focused on good, coachable people with solid leadership skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once my management team was in place, I hired support staff. I settled on 2 QC techs that would be tasked with training and QCing work in the field. They were pricey hires. And traditionally, you try to keep your overhead as low as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believed that if we invested in quality, we would see more than our fair share of return on investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it was time to hire the employees who would be hands-on in the field. My managers and I began an interview process that affirmed everything my gut told me to be true. Many of the candidates with great experience in a similar company were bad fits. There was something about them that rubbed me the wrong way. Their attitudes were different, they spoke a different kind of technical language, and my intuition told me to pass. I’m so glad I did!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Holding up a fist\" class=\"wp-image-3471\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-240x300.jpg 240w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-768x960.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“I was focused on good, coachable people with solid leadership skills.”</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Rebel Culture</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, we hired only about 20 people out of the 42 that applied. This meant I was still in need of around 20 more employees. So, we got to work by holding mass interviews. We posted the job to craigslist and said if anyone was interested in bringing his or her application and we would give them a chance to interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the criteria we used:<br>-Did they have ambitions?<br>-Did they have leadership skills?<br>-Where they independent?<br>-Did they stay at a job for longer than 2 years?<br>-Did they show a positive attitude?<br>-Did they show enthusiasm to learn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A team, full of people who checked those boxes, was finally assembled. And I’ll be honest with you, I was tempted the entire time to hire based on skill and experience at the neglect of cultural fit. I fully believe that if we had gone that route, our company would have suffered, our employees would have been miserable, and we would not have seen the kind of growth we saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the very beginning, evidenced in our slow hiring process, we developed culture as the rebels of the locate world. And everyone bought in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"working in shared offices\" class=\"wp-image-3472\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/venveo-609390-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I learned something simple but extremely essential to business: Culture trumps strategy every time.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can start the way we started, you’ll find that your managers don’t have to drive culture. Instead, the culture will drive everything you do. Your attrition rates will be lower that every business around you and your employees from top to bottom will love working for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, go and start a rebel culture of your own!</p>\n","uri":"culture-trumps-everything","date":"2018-11-16T19:51:37"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDY5","uri":"culture-trumps-everything","postId":3469,"title":"Culture Trumps Everything","featuredImage":{"altText":"Holding up a fist","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/miguel-bruna-503098-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
