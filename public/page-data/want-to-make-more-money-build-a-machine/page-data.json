Build a machine","content":"\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Whether you’re part of a small or large business, processes and systems are paramount to your success. The gist is that you need a way for your team to understand why and how you do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">I think they value structure and clear expectations. That’s what good processes and systems will bring to your business, and you’ll see it in the bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A lot of small businesses struggle with this because employees wear multiple hats. In our boutique, for example, our General Manager is also Chief Operations Officer, Director of PR and Marketing, and Sales Manager. Because our boutique has so many moving parts, and so many people doing different jobs, we have had to think of the best way to ensure that all of our processes (1) made sense and (2) were being followed. It has been our streamlined and quality processes that turned our small business into a money-making machine. Here’s how!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Split the business into departments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This is pretty simple to do. But, as I said, it’s not the first thing small business owners think about. Make a list of the different roles and functions in your organization and then categorize them into departments. To make it easier, think about what processes and systems go together. In other words, who needs to communicate the most with each other. We split ours into:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Marketing</li><li>Sales</li><li>Administration</li><li>Finance</li><li>Merchandising</li><li>Management</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Create a management role for each department</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">After you divided your different functions into departments, create a managerial role for each one. Obviously, you don’t have to have a manager for each department, especially when your resources are slim but, you do need to have the role. Why? Because when things go wrong, you need one person to be accountable. And your employees need to know who to go to for each major systems issue in your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/william-iven-19843-unsplash-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1819\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/william-iven-19843-unsplash-1024x680.jpg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/william-iven-19843-unsplash-300x199.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/william-iven-19843-unsplash-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Assign a person to each management role</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">This is where it can get a little tricky. In your company, you may not have someone capable of managing. Be encouraged that the people you’re putting into these spots they are not really managing and developing people. They are managing processes. So, you just need to find people who are bought-in and who have the ability to communicate the processes clearly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Keep in mind, as you appoint managers in a small business, one person might manage multiple departments. As you grow, you’ll onboard full-time managers who can oversee specific departments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">If you institute this one small tweak to your business, you can see it turn into a machine ready for expansion and major profits.</p>\n","uri":"want-to-make-more-money-build-a-machine"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoxODE4","uri":"want-to-make-more-money-build-a-machine","postId":1818,"title":"Want to make more money?
