As a business owner, you’re navigating a sea of competitors and the local and global economy. The better diversified your revenue streams are, the higher the odds are that you’ll continue to fare well, even in times of economic slowdowns. Get started today with these three tips for uncovering alternative revenue streams&#8230;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Survey Your Customers.<br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering what you could introduce next, the best people to provide input are the people who you plan to sell to- your customers! Think about asking your regular, most-valued customers what they love most about your business and what they wish your business offered that it currently does not have. This will be a great start to get the creative juices flowing!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Introduce Services.<br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a product-based business, think about what types of complimentary services you could introduce. This is particularly important for small businesses selling in an era of Amazon (major competition across a slew of industries) and showrooming, a new consumer habit of perusing physical stores in person while comparing prices for better deals online.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your products are at risk due to any of these factors, start thinking beyond products and move into experiences. What type of services related to the products you sell and will get shoppers to return more often? What services will make your shoppers feel more compelled to visit your physical location rather than shopping with competitors online?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Car parts testing, oil changes and tire rotations at auto parts stores&nbsp;</li><li>Health assessments and wellness workshops at nutritional health and supplement stores</li><li>Manicures, makeup, and blowouts at fashion retail stores&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/austin-distel-744oGeqpxPQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2074\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/austin-distel-744oGeqpxPQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/austin-distel-744oGeqpxPQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/austin-distel-744oGeqpxPQ-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Make the Most of Your Space.&nbsp;<br></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re fortunate enough to have extra space at your physical location, consider the benefits of introducing a co-working space, cafe or other extra designed to encourage shoppers to stay around longer and return often. You’ll build community and revenue at the same time.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When executed properly, this can be a wonderful idea for fashion boutiques, restaurants, bookstores, business centers and more. In fact, it’s a concept that can even work for businesses as diverse as beauty salons and car washes as long as the adjoining space is physically separated and marketed in a way that makes sense! Analyze factors including your geographic location, your brand, and your price points as you build out your ideas.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating a concept such as co-working also allows you to introduce a membership business model, a great way to approximate how much money your new revenue stream will rake in each month.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Felix del Toro, SVP, Chief Merchandise and Design Officer at Fabletics had this to say about the concept at the American Apparel and Footwear Association’s 2019 Executive Summit: &#8220;I think the reckoning on space is certainly long overdue. The other conversation or another avenue for this is really: what is complementary? What gives the consumer another experience? Whether it&#8217;s working spaces, how else can they carve up space for it to be meaningful to add to that guest experience when they are in that space?&#8221;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling inspired? Do any new ideas come to mind? Stay true to your vision and customers and you’ll come up with a new revenue stream in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quote Source: <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/take-care-how-an-indie-store-is-merging-coworking-and-retail/551348/\">https://www.retaildive.com/news/take-care-how-an-indie-store-is-merging-coworking-and-retail/551348/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","uri":"how-to-uncover-alternative-revenue-streams-for-your-business"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMDcz","uri":"how-to-uncover-alternative-revenue-streams-for-your-business","postId":2073,"title":"How to Uncover Alternative Revenue Streams for Your Business"}}}
