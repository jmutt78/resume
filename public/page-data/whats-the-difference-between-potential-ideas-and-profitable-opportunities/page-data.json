To distinguish a profitable opportunity from an initial idea, entrepreneurs need to analyze its viability. There are many different tools and approaches you can take to assess whether an idea is an actual, realistic business opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview with Brandon Ward, he shares the process he went through to launch Advisory Cure. He shares that many of the businesses he started have been based on problems he wanted solutions to. “I feel a great place to start is with ourselves. Is this something we would want? Would we pay for it? What have others said about it. From my perspective, it&#8217;s all about the market. Sometimes we desire things, but that doesn’t necessarily make them viable ideas, so I always look to qualify the idea based on real people and the market, starting with myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are six considerations for taking a potential idea into a profitable business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\"src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48422651_10112879111658843_1364654110875320320_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2136\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48422651_10112879111658843_1364654110875320320_n.jpg 960w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48422651_10112879111658843_1364654110875320320_n-300x200.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48422651_10112879111658843_1364654110875320320_n-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Identify what’s driving you to become an entrepreneur</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs may be driven by either opportunity or necessity. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurs are seeking independence through wealth creation and innovation, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs may not have other options. For Brandon, freedom was a huge driving force in making the transition from employee to entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gain entrepreneurial skills through experience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever felt intimidated by ‘overnight successes’ or business owners who appear to be naturally-gifted with entrepreneurial qualities? The truth is that many entrepreneurs take years to launch. “Being an entrepreneur is always something I wanted to do. I just never had anyone around me who had done that before, so I’ve been fumbling my way through the dark for over a decade figuring it out.” Brandon shares.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 2015 to 2018, Brandon was employed as a Marketing Manager. While working full time, he started taking on freelance and contractor jobs on the side. Then, unexpectedly he was offering the position of CEO for Lifted Innovations Inc. in 2018. “This was a huge excitement for me as it was in the cannabis/CBD space and was something I’ve always dreamed about. It was a startup, one of the shareholders thought I would be a great fit and wanted to mentor me. I learned so much but realized that I have to start my own company. It gave me the confidence I needed to take the full-blown leap into entrepreneurship..”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose niche markets that cater to specific needs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When generating business ideas, it’s not always possible to create a whole new market, however, you can still stand out in an existing marketplace with a unique offering or by choosing a specific niche. Brandon’s company, Advisory Cure, specializing in helping tech startups develop and execute inbound marketing strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brandon took the time to reflect on not only what he wanted to do but also to research the market. “I talked to many business associates and friends. It became very obvious to me how much people needed help with marketing, strategy, and execution.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the CEO of Lifted Innovations Inc., he had experienced challenges in finding professional marketing help. “Knowing the importance of strategic marketing, the number of companies who struggle in this space, and the gap between the quality of agencies inspired us to become the company we wished existed in the market.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get support for your startup</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2135\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-150x150.jpg 150w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-300x300.jpg 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-768x768.jpg 768w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o-60x60.jpg 60w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28827104_10103106374058703_8149898532282049752_o.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“I decided to start an agency with my former EA from Lifted. We wanted to create a company that we wish existed when we were running Lifted.” For Brandon, having a great business partner was a game-changer and he now feels empowered to do what he does best. “Being a CEO taught me the power of delegation and focusing on what our strengths are.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Source funding for the new venture</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brandon warns new and future entrepreneurs to be careful when considering bringing on investors and giving away equity. “Short term money can be nice, but there are often hidden sacrifices to be made when taking in investors.” If you’re also an opportunity-driven entrepreneur seeking freedom, then having investors might get messy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He adds that he prefers loans. “I’ve found a few great non-profit organizations for startups that have been fantastic to work with. They’re far less predatory and you have a chance to tell your story and get buy-in. From a freedom perspective, this is my preference understanding you need to really trust the business model you’ve defined.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Think like an entrepreneur (not an employee) to foster growth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For entrepreneurs looking to move from startup to growth stage, Brandon recommends being strategic about working on the business as a leader, instead of inside it as an employee. Many professionals fall into the trap of treating their business as a job. “Running and building a successful company requires a much different skill set than what’s needed to be a successful employee.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, he adds. “Always remember, building businesses aren’t for everyone and often our friends and family mean well, but most likely they won’t get it. It’s going to suck. You’re going to feel alone. Some days you will wonder why in the world you’re doing it, but never forget the all-important why as to what drives you. It’s natural to feel like this, but keep with it! Persistence and perseverance will always win out over perfection!”</p>\n","uri":"whats-the-difference-between-potential-ideas-and-profitable-opportunities"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTI5","uri":"whats-the-difference-between-potential-ideas-and-profitable-opportunities","postId":2129,"title":"What’s the difference between potential ideas and profitable opportunities?"}}}
