Start streamlining your entrepreneurial experience today&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/16d7e6-1024x675.png\" alt=\"asana\" class=\"wp-image-2118\" srcset=\"http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/16d7e6-1024x675.png 1024w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/16d7e6-300x198.png 300w, http://entra.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/16d7e6-768x506.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Asana </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Project management can be a headache-inducing, time-sucking affair in the already busy life of a business owner. Until you scale up to a site where you can hire someone to only focus on this, it’s critical to add the right tools to the equation. <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> is definitely that tool. Create one or more workspaces, invite team members, assign tasks and enjoy oversight over what has been completed, what is pending, deadlines, project details and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\"src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cLZeARKf7kI/WlPXx_Icg6I/AAAAAAAAGSo/-_mYBVdWc8g9tDuOEI9OZH_x2z_YCNClACLcBGAs/s1600/SearchInDriveFolder.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Google Drive </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since basically everyone has <a href=\"https://www.google.com/drive/\">Google Drive</a>, it’s something that is often taken for granted. However, this easy to use set of tools earns its ubiquity as a must-have tool for project management and organization. It always comes with a substantial amount of storage space that may be upgraded for more according to your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Google Docs</em>: Write important company documents in Google Docs to allow real-time access to specific members of your team. It saves automatically and in real-time as you write and you can also save the results as a word processing doc or PDF to save elsewhere as a backup. It’s excellent for managing your freelance team as well. Share documents with your freelance graphic designer or copywriter to have access to every new version of the file and to be able to comment and add information as necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Google Sheets: </em>Look to Google Sheets for the same advantages as Google Docs- namely real-time editing and easy access to sharing files and ensuring everyone is referencing the same version of a spreadsheet. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\"src=\"https://media2.giphy.com/media/xT9IgHb75OMPtN8u6A/source.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Google Calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a company event coming up or you need to schedule a series of weekly meetings for your team? <a href=\"https://www.google.com/calendar\">Google Calendar</a> is your tool. You can use <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\">Google Hangouts</a> for video calls or share call information for other services (i.e. Skype, a mobile number or a conference call access number). Every event shows the name of every person who has been invited, including who has RSVP’d as attending, as maybe and who will not be able to attend. There’s also room to include a description of the event to ensure all parties will be prepared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons to love Google Calendar, including the fact that it easily syncs with other calendars (such as Calendar on Mac) and scheduling platforms such as Calendly (more on that below), and that it will send you helpful email reminders or push notifications before events.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"https://signaturesatori.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/calendly-process.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Calendly </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If client calls or meetings are a daily reality for your business, take the time to look into <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\">Calendly</a>. It’s an incredible scheduling tool that syncs with your calendar so you can share the link for scheduling time with you with ease. Link recipients see your available days and times in the current time zone of their own computers to book an appointment with you in just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re also able to update meeting criteria for a high level of personal preferences, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The amount of buffer time between calls or meetings (included to account for travel time)</li><li>Days or times you don’t want to take meetings or calls</li><li>The time allotment options for meetings and calls (i.e. 20 minutes or an hour)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Email reminders ensure you never miss a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img style=\"width:100%; height:auto; margin-left:-35px;\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/fe1qHrDoDHG0oFW6sc/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Slack </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you haven’t heard of <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> before, you’re in for a serious treat. Enjoy a workspace including channels of your choosing, where you can invite specific team members to access different channels. For example, a channel for your business’ press may include your marketing manager, your web team who updates press on your site and your social media manager who shares new press with your audiences. Slack offers the ability to send private, one-on-one messages, group chats, video, and audio calls, file-sharing, easy lifetime search access to reference past conversations and files and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also add special plug-ins to enhance your experience, based on your needs, including adding connections to and capabilities from Google Drive, Asana and <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>. One word of caution, be sure to make all of your notifications silent and otherwise configure notifications to suit your needs so you won’t get overwhelmed. Spend 5-10 minutes configuring your settings, it will definitely be worth the wait.</p>\n","uri":"5-management-and-organizational-tools-youll-love"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"cG9zdDoyMTE3","uri":"5-management-and-organizational-tools-youll-love","postId":2117,"title":"5  Management and Organizational Tools You’ll Love"}}}
