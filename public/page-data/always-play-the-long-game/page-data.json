Maybe it’s the culture in which we grew up or the way that we’re wired… or a little bit of both. You and I have difficulty seeing beyond today and planning for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s why so many people get to retirement age and realize they should have saved for retirement. It’s the reason why so many teenagers start smoking, not thinking about the long-term impact of their short-term decisions. Think of spur-of-the-moment weddings in Vegas, playing the lottery, the list goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough for anybody to think about life in the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re in business, or you’re just starting out, listen to me You need to think the long game. You need to have a long-term vision for your company or you will make unwise unrepairable choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stumbled into this lesson early on in my career. We were waiting to hear about the contract in Texas. Remember that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://justinmcintoshs.com/2018/10/the-power-of-customer-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">story</a>? Texas heat and no Air Conditioning. It was as wonderful as it sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"a road to nowhere\" class=\"wp-image-3422\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>“We made no money on the job in Vega. But, we eventually became the go-to contractor for the client, a contract that made us millions of dollars and propelled our business forward.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were waiting to hear whether we got the full contract, we were asked by the company to drive back to Texas and perform a quick, standards audit in the neighboring town of Vega. We knew that wouldn’t make any money, we but wanted to show our client that we were willing to do whatever it took to make her happy. So, we drove to Vega in the middle of November, a stark contrast to the blistering summer months I’d experienced before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad and I shared a room at a fleabag hotel, the dream of any American college student. I still remember listening to the sound of my dad snoring and getting absolutely no sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal was to get the project finished in one day so that we would at least come out even on the deal. So, I jogged alongside my father’s truck going from pole to pole, yelling out the measurements for my dad to write down. The job was finished by 6 o’clock and my dad and I headed home.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/62439_525124217525996_1316479203_n.jpg\" alt=\"Justin and Skip McIntosh\" class=\"wp-image-3424\" srcset=\"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/62439_525124217525996_1316479203_n.jpg 747w, https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/62439_525124217525996_1316479203_n-300x202.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why I tell you this seemingly mundane story. We made no money on the job in Vega. But, we eventually became the go-to contractor for the client, a contract that made us millions of dollars and propelled our business forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we had been short-sided, we would have turned down the job and hoped for one to come along that paid more. Fortunately, we went to Vega and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid the trap of short-sidedness. Always play the long game. You’ll thank me later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you naturally think short-term or long-term?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re inclined to think short-term, what mechanisms could you put in place to help you make the right business decisions?</p>\n","uri":"always-play-the-long-game","date":"2018-10-26T16:15:54"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDIw","uri":"always-play-the-long-game","postId":3420,"title":"Always Play the Long Game","featuredImage":{"altText":"a road to nowhere","sourceUrl":"https://entra.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/huib-scholten-373239-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}}
